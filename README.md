# 673-Final-Project
This page shows data of prescribed burns that have been documented with the Kentucky Prescribed Fire Council since initiation in 2013.

In order to build this webpage, I used the BootStrap CSS styling to take advantage of their grid styling capabilities. In addition, It used the layoutit! tool to design the page with a user friendly interface.

To build the map itself I used a variety of tools. First of all I got a Kentucky 2018 Counties Shapefile from the US Census Burea and imported it using the d3. JS library. I used d3 to create and SVG item within my #map container, and also to draw my counties to the map.

I used Getbootstrap.com for help with CSS styling and some Javascript interactivity of UI's.

Used the d3 and Jquery JS libraries extensively to add interactivity, function, color schemes, and import/manage data.
